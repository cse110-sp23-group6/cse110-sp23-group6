## Today's Topics
 
#### General Brainstorm of Ideas: 

Process:
1. Ask user what kind of question they want to ask and have user pick which category (relationship, food, career and etc)
2. make user pick from 5 pictures(or quotes or whatever) → use the chart from above
3. ask the user for birthday/occupation: student or working (cater responses according to their occupation??) 
4. give general reading – for the month
   1. Can include what emotions they are based on answers to picture questions 
   2. Reading based on category & current emotion (ex: do we give more positive reading if the person is sad??) 
5. user can ask question (only with chat gpt)
6. give answer
   1. prompt chat GPT** important
   2. bunch of generic ones (200 - 300)
7. repeat 4 and 5
