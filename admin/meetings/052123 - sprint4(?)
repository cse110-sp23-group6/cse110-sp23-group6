#Agenda
 - merge everything
 - go through website to talk about what we need improvements on
 - other comments or concerns
 - dev branch approach


Need fixing:

General reading — screenshot looks ugly - bao , Prisha
 - header and share home button should be down 
 - share and home should be icons 
- Emotion and reading should be down
- Reading needs padding
- Maybe a typing animation to make it mystical -

Previous Fortunes
 - text standardization - Wilson
 - Back button should be HOME and also should work - Haven
 - if you delete a fortune and go back to it, it shows up again - Haven

Main page is ugly, have the header down - Fayaz
 - I shouldn’t be able to click previous fortunes when I don’t have any fortunes
Choose your fortune 
 - make it faster
 - make icons smaller

Standardize hovering over button - Jose 

Sounds - botao, Haven

Emotions 2 - header comes down to 2 lines it shouldn’t be doing that - Jose

File minification - Amit


Option 1
 - clicking new fortune gives the same thing sometimes 
Option 2 - Amit
 - Spotify API


Testing.- Vasil Jose Fayaz Brian
